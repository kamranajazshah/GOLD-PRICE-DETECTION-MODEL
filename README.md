A Gold Price Detection Model using Random Forest is designed to predict the future price movements of gold based on historical data and relevant features. Here's a detailed description of how such a model might work:

Overview:
Objective: To predict the future price movement (increase or decrease) of gold based on historical data and other influencing factors.

Methodology: The model utilizes the Random Forest algorithm, a powerful ensemble learning technique, to make predictions. Random Forest builds multiple decision trees and merges their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.A Gold Price Detection Model using Random Forest is designed to predict the future price movements of gold based on historical data and relevant features.
